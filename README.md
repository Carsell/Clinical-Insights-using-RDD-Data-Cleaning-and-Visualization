# Clinical-Insights-using-RDD-Data-Cleaning-and-Visualization

This project demonstrates how to manage files in Databricks, particularly focusing on listing files, copying, and unzipping files using PySpark and Python utilities. The primary aim is to handle multiple datasets stored in different formats and prepare them for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Project Structure

The project contains a Jupyter Notebook with the following main sections:

1. **Import Necessary Libraries**: Importing essential libraries such as `csv`, `os`, `calendar`, `matplotlib`, and PySpark's `SparkSession`.
2. **List Files in Directory**: Using Databricks utilities to list files in the `/FileStore/tables/` directory.
3. **File Copy and Unzip Function**: A Python function `copy_and_unzip` to copy zip files from Databricks FileStore to a local temporary directory, unzip them, and then move the extracted CSV files back to the FileStore.
4. **Unzip Specific Files**: Using the `copy_and_unzip` function to unzip specific clinical trial and pharma datasets.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/databricks-file-management.git
    ```

2. **Install Necessary Libraries**:
    Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Most of these should already be available in a Databricks environment.
    - `pyspark`
    - `matplotlib`

    You can install additional libraries via pip if running locally:
    ```sh
    pip install pyspark matplotlib
    ```

3. **Upload to Databricks**:
    - Upload the `.ipynb` file to your Databricks workspace.
    - Ensure your data files are located in the `/FileStore/tables/` directory or update the paths accordingly in the notebook.

## Usage

1. **Run the Notebook**:
    - Open the notebook in Databricks and run all cells to execute the file management and unzipping processes.
    - Modify the file paths and names as needed for your specific datasets.

2. **Adapt Functions for Your Needs**:
    - The `copy_and_unzip` function can be adapted to handle different file types or perform additional processing steps after unzipping.
